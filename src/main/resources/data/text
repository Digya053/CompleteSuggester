Every season has the beauty of its own. The summer brings joy among the animals and enhances their freedom. 
The winter frees us from insects. Spring brings glow in the world and flowers unveil brightly. 
Rainy season sheds the stain of the world and flows through the solitary dryness.

Living things with their freedom of not just action but thoughts experience the real freedom.
With the advent of spring, an eternal fragrance of joy fill everyone. 
You can captivate a being in chains but you cannot kill its thoughts. A mind is just a walled garden.
Even paradise feels like a cage once you get hold the idea of its walls.
Living beings with their thoughts thrive for freedom indeed. Physical freedom is mere an illusion.
You cannot kill an idea, a thought. An idea lives for eternity. You can capture an idea, but cannot cage it.
It is the mind where an idea and a thought thrives. Kill a mind and you kill an idea. But really, you cannot
kill a mind for it shall remain for eternity.

It is the idea of seasons that is analogous to freedom.
With each seasons comes freedom and thus the consequences of freedom. 
It is the idea of seasons where varieties of living beings thrive.
It is the idea of seasons where flowers fade and rise.
It is the idea of seasons where flowers unveil.
It is the idea of seasons where weather stops being tedious.
It is the idea of seasons where the varieties can be known.
It is the idea of seasons where one thinks about time.
It is the idea of seasons where living beings dance with the rhythms of time.
It is the idea of seasons that mixes different tastes within our soul.
It is the idea of seasons that gives us hope.
Yet you cannot kill an idea. You cannot capture an idea. An idea gets passed from one from to the other.
Yet it is the idea of seasons that spawns the thoughts about an idea.
